### What is the task?

This should be a short description.

### Definition of Done

What has to be accomplished for this task to be completely done?
It should be quickly verifiable by the code reviewer. If it takes the reviewer
more than a trivial amount of time to understand how to run the function
with sample inputs, where to find the presentation, etc. the task will be considered
incomplete until clarification is provided.

For example:
- function that takes in a string and returns all named entities as a list
- short presentation summarizing the BERT paper for teammates
- required steps outlined to implement coreference resolution and tasks created

### Resources

Optional. Resources that might be relevant to complete this task. These will often be shared in slack too.
