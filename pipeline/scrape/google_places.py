        The Google Places API permits searching for POIs within a radius around
        a given point. Therefore, data is extracted by dividing the
        geography's bounding box into cells of equal size and then searching
        within the circular areas that circumscribe (i.e., perfectly enclose)
        those cells.

        To circumscribe a cell, the circle must have a radius that is
        one-half the length of the cell's diagonal (as derived from the
        Pythagorean Theorem). Let `side` equal the length of a cell's side.
        It follows that the radius is:

        ```
        radius = (√2/2) * side
        ```

        Google Places sets a cap on the radius search size, so after solving for `side`,
        it follows that cell sizes are restricted as follows:

        ```
        max_side = √2 * max_radius
        ```

        Therefore, the bounding box must be split into _at least_ the following
        number of cells along the x- and y- (i.e., longitude and latitude)
        directions to avoid having cells that are too big:

        ```
        min_num_splits = ceil(bounding_box_length / max_side)
        ```

        Finally, at the time of writing, only 20 records are returned per
        search query, even if more businesses are available. Therefore, it
        is important to confirm that less than 20 records are returned
        in the response to avoid missing data.
