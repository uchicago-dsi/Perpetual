        Args:
            data (`dict`): The data model used for the simulation.

            manager (`pywrapcp.RoutingIndexManager`): The manager for
                any `NodeIndex` <-> variable index conversion. The routing
                solver uses variable indices internally and through its
                API. These variable indices are tricky to manage directly
                because one `Node` can correspond to a multitude of variables,
                depending on the number of times they appear in the model,
                and if they're used as start and/or end points. This class
                aims to simplify variable index usage, allowing users to
                use `NodeIndex` instead.

            routing (`pywrapcp.RoutingModel`): Wraps the routing manager
                with additional functionality.

            solution (`pywrapcp.Assignment`): The routing solution, which
                consists of one or more routes to visit all locations
                given any capacity constraints.

        Returns:
            A three-item tuple consisting of (1) a list of lists of route indices,
                (2) a list of lists of cumulative route distances, and (3) a
                list of lists of cumulative vehicle load. Each individual list
                corresponds to a unique route identified within the solution.
